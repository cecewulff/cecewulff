    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>My name is Cece Wulff, I use she/her pronouns and I am a full time student at the 
    University of Puget Sound!</h2>
    <p>I grew up in Como Park, a neighborhood in St. Paul, Minnesota. I like to think that Washington state
        is like Minnesota, with its vast wilderness and grey skied winters, except not nearly as flat and 
        without the blistering cold to accompany those skies. 
    </p>

    <p>I have always enjoyed learning about how things work, finding similarities and connections between two 
        seemingly very different things and I've realized how important hands on learning is for me. For these reasons
        and a few others, it made sense to me to pursue biology. 

    <p>When not in class or studying, I enjoying spending time outside in the sun, being with friends, rock climbing, 
        playing cribbage or a good game of yahtzee, all while listening to music.
