    <h6>Technical Projects</h6>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>In CSCI 161, we were challenged to write a program that replicated the process
                used in pooled COVID testing to determine positive individuals. This process was significant
                because it didn't require each and every sample to be tested, saving time and money. I believe 
                we used arrays or arraylists to store the various pools and worked through each pool using loops if a positive
                sample was detected.  </li>

            <li>In CSCI 261, we worked on a project that involved HTML, we created a program that looked 
                through HTML code for syntax errors. This code required many if and else statements in an attempt
                to catch all possible mistyped or mismatched characters. This became especially challenging as 
                some tags are more than one character, meaning that we had to be especially careful with scanners. </li>
